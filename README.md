### Hi there! Welcome to my Github page! My name is Isaiah and I'm a Software Engineer. Coffee and Code is my life motto. I have dipped my feet in many programming languages and fell in love with the MERN stack and Python(w/ Django).

- âš¡ Who am I?: I was raised by a single mom even with her struggles she pushed me to be the best person I can be. My eyes were opened by my pastor who did coding as a career. He then introduced me to the beautiful staff of [Bitwise](https://bitwiseindustries.com/){:target="_blank"} Next thing you know I'm taking classes at [Geekwise](https://bitwiseindustries.com/services/workforce-training/classes/){:target="_blank"}. My main goal in life is to become a full-time software engineer at a company that will value my presence and help troubled youth and show them the amazing world of code.
